                <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: large;"><b style="color: blue;">## Understanding Mental Health - </b><br/>Mental health, refers to our cognitive, behavioral, and emotional wellbeing. It's all about how we think, feel, and behave. Mental health can affect daily life, relationships, and even physical health.</p>
                <br/>
                <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: large;"><b style="color: blue;">## The Importance of Mental Health Awareness - </b><br/>Mental health awareness is crucial because it helps us understand that mental health is essential to overall well-being. It's just as important as physical health, and it's time we start treating it as such.</p>
                <br/>
                <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: large;"><b style="color: blue;">## Mental Health in University Students - </b><br/>University students are at a significant stage in their lives where they are exposed to new experiences, ideas, and people. While this can be an exciting time, it can also be stressful and challenging, leading to various mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and more.</p>
                <br/>
                <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: large;"><b style="color: blue;">## How Mental Health Affects Students - </b><br/>Poor mental health can affect a student's ability to perform academically and socially. It can lead to lower grades, dropping out of school, or other adverse outcomes. It's essential to address these issues promptly and provide the necessary support.</p>
                <br/>
                <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: large;"><b style="color: blue;">## What We Can Do - </b><br/>Promoting mental health awareness in universities involves creating an environment that supports mental health and helps students manage stress. This can be achieved through workshops, counseling services, peer support, and more. Remember, it's okay to ask for help. If you or someone you know is struggling, reach out to a mental health professional.</p>
